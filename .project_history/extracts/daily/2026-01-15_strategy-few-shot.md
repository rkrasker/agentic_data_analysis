# Daily Reconciliation: Few-Shot Strategy (2026-01-15)

Summary of the few-shot strategy discussion for resolver-era consolidation:

- Few-shot should use curated soldier-level exemplars aligned to component and common collision rivals.
- Exemplars should include raw records, extracted signals, final consolidated assignment, and a brief rationale.
- Per-batch injection assumes a strong component hint or near-homogeneous batches; otherwise add a routing step or multi-component exemplars.
- Maintain a compact exemplar bank per component/collision; select relevant examples per batch and inject alongside resolvers or as a fallback when resolver sections are sparse.

Open follow-ups:
- Define exemplar selection heuristics and storage format.
- Decide on routing behavior when component hints are weak.
