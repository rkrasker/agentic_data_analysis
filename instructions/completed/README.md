# Completed Instructions

Archive of completed task handoffs.

## Why Keep These

- Reference for similar future tasks
- Audit trail of what was implemented when
- Context for debugging if issues arise later

## Naming

Same as active: `NNN_[task-name].md`

Files move here from `active/` upon completion.

## Completion Checklist

Before moving here, verify:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Code activity logged in `.project_history/code-activity/`
- [ ] Relevant CURRENT.md updated with implementation status
- [ ] Status field in instruction updated to "complete"
