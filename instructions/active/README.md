# Active Instructions

Store task handoffs for Claude Code here.

## Naming Convention

`NNN_[task-name].md`

Examples:
- `001_resolver-generator-phase1.md`
- `002_batch-manager.md`
- `003_regex-extractor.md`

Number sequentially. Gaps are fine (after completion/removal).

## Workflow

1. Create instruction from template (`templates/instruction_template.md`)
2. Reference relevant `docs/components/.../CURRENT.md`
3. Hand off to Claude Code
4. On completion, move to `completed/`
5. Log activity in `.history/code-activity/`
6. Update relevant CURRENT.md with implementation status
