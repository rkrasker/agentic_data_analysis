Therefore, these terms are treated as neutral in this specific disambiguation context. Disambiguation relies entirely on the presence of unique identifiers: the division number (101 vs 82), the division nickname (Screaming Eagles vs All American), or a unique subordinate unit (e.g., 506th PIR vs 505th PIR).
