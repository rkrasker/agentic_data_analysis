# landing_zone

Temporary holding area for reference documents or code fragments from other projects.

Lifecycle
- Drop items here for short-term context during a session.
- After use, move them into a dated archive folder under `landing_zone/archive/`.
- If long-term retention is not needed, delete the originals after extracting the relevant gist.

Archive example
- `landing_zone/archive/2025-01-15/`

Notes
- `.gitkeep` is used to keep empty archive templates tracked in Git.
