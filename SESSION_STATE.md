## Active Task
Documentation restructure to support multi-agent workflow optimization.

## Current Approach
Created comprehensive instruction file for Sonnet to execute documentation restructure. Designed context packet system, session wrap-up prompts, and code style guide.

## Where I Left Off
Instruction file complete. Ready to execute in Claude Code with Sonnet.

## Open Questions
- May need to refine context packets based on actual usage
- Custom slash commands for /wrapup deferred to later

## Recent Context
